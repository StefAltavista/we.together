Since I had only one hour of time I focused on the responsivity of the Navigation bar, the layout of the first section of the landing page and implemented a little server with Express.js.
App working both on desktop and mobile view

Both in Dev and in Build mode user MUST run the server in ./server/server.js for static content.
Redy to deploy build files can be found in ./dist

To run in Production mode

Terminal 1 - npm start
Terminal 2 - npm run prod

To run in Development mode:

Terminal 1 - npm i
...wait for packages installation to complete
Terminal 1 - npm start
Terminal 2 - npm run dev
