Since I had only one hour of time I focused on the responsivity of the Navigation bar, the layout of the first section of the landing page and implemented a little server with Express.js

App working both on desktop and mobile view

Both in Dev and in Build mode please run the server in ./server/server.js for static content.
Complete build can be found in ./dist

To run in Dev mode:

1 - npm start
2 - npm run dev

I used Webpack because i find it more conviniet and quick when theres the need of a Node / Express server.
