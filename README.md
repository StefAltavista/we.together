Both in Dev and in Prod mode user MUST run the server in ./server/server.js for static content.
To run the server Express.js package needs to be installed.

To run in Production mode

Terminal 1
`npm i express`
`npm start`
Terminal 2
`npm run prod`

To run in Development mode:

Terminal 1 
`npm i`
...wait for packages installation to complete
`npm start`
Terminal 2
`npm run dev`

Since I had only one hour of time I focused on the responsivity of the Navigation bar, the layout of the first section of the landing page and implemented a little server with Express.js.
App working both on desktop and mobile view
